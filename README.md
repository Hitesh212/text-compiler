# text-files-copier

## Uses
The reason I made this program was to take all the python files I had been using as notes and put them into a central text file for easier referencing. It works great with control-f. 

## Features
Search up into 4x sub directories,
filter by keyword
can copy from multiple file types

## Still needs
Ability to skip files that can't be decoded or find a workaround to decode
